# CBC Grade 8 Mathematics digital textbook Project

This repository contains the source files for the CBC Grade 7 Mathematics book, developed using [PreTeXt](https://pretextbook.org) and will incoorporate [STACK](https://stack-assessment.org/) exercises for student's personalised learning. PreTeXt is a powerful tool for creating high-quality educational materials, including textbooks, in multiple formats.

## Project Overview

This initiative is part of a larger project focused on developing digital Open Educational Resources (OERs) for Kenyan secondary schools. The main goal is to create a comprehensive and accessible digital mathematics textbook for Grade 8 students, fully aligned with the Competency-Based Curriculum (CBC).

The initial version of the textbook will be developed by a team of 10 interns, who will design the content and assessment materials from scratch. Digital STACK questions, created separately, will be integrated into the subsections of the book to help students test and reinforce their understanding of key concepts.

The review process, covering both the textbook and the exercises, will provide an opportunity for broader contributions from teachers, students, and other education stakeholders. Development will remain continuous, incorporating feedback and suggestions to ensure the resource becomes increasingly responsive to the needs of teachers, learners, and CBC requirements, while also meeting international standards.

Furthermore, the textbook will be designed to be easily adaptable to different contexts, making it suitable for adoption by other countries seeking similar resources. 

The book will be available in multiple formats, including web, PDF, and print. The web version of the book will offer the digital assessments that will help students have a more engaging personalised learning experience from the immediate feedback STACK questions provides.

# Enablers of the project

This project was initially supported by a grant from the US Embassy in Nairobi. The initial support enalbed hiring of 10 interns who were trained in authoring the textbook in PreTeXt by [Prof Oscar Levin](https://math.oscarlevin.com/) and trained in STACK authoring by the INNODEMS team. Other enablers of this project are:
1. **INNODEMS**  
   [INNODEMS](https://innodems.org/) is the organization that supports the interns and coordinates the development of the textbook project locally in Kenya. 

2. **IDEMS**   
     [IDEMS](https://www.idems.international/) has provided expartise in the integration of PreTeXt and STACK and will provide the technical support for the piloting phase of the textbooks.

4. **SAMI**   
        [SAMI](https://samicharity.co.uk/home) is a UK NGO that leads the fundraising drive to support the development and piloting of the ktextbooks.  

## Support the project

    You can support the textbook project through contributing to the development of the books or by donating to INNODEMS to help keep the vision of the ptoject alive.
